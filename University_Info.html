		The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, also known as UNC, or simply Carolina,[11] is a public research university 
		located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States. It is one of the 17 campuses of the University of North Carolina system. 
		After being chartered in 1789, the university first began enrolling students in 1795, which also allows it to be one of three 
		schools to claim the title of the oldest public university in the United States.
		I want to go here but not as much as Duke or even App State.
		I have no advantage to get into here.

		Appalachian State University is a comprehensive public, coeducational university in Boone, North Carolina, United States.

		It expanded to include other programs in 1967, and joined the University of North Carolina system in 1971. 
		It is the system's sixth largest with about 18,000 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students.
		It offers 174 undergraduate and 37 graduate majors as well as a doctoral degree in educational leadership.
		I want to go here because it's ranked one of the best non-ivy league colleges in the world and has a good computer science program.
		My brother goes here so maybe that would give me some advantages once i got in if i needed help.
