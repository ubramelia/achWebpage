		<p class="normalText">
		Every good mystery starts with introducing the characters and setting the scene.  So close
		your eyes; Imagine a chubby little girl who watches too much Glee and dresses like Ashley Tisdale
		circa 2000. If you're picturing a hot mess, you're right on the money because that little girl
		was me. One day I was at one of those city events where they do raffles and sell $5 sodas and $15
		funnel cakes when I see a stand playing 'I'll Make a Man Out of You' from Mulan while a guy with
		a stick danced in front of it.  I was visibly intrigued so a girl walked up, handed me a flyer,
		and asked if I wanted to audition for a production of Mulan: The jr. Broadway Musical
		with a community theatre company called Debbie's Angels Productions.  I said yes and few months
		later I was badly performing onstage a song I never learned the notes to as Grandmother Fa while I 
		nevously sweated through my stage makeup (more on that later). From that moment on I was *shiver*
		<i>A THEATRE KID</i>. <br>
		</p>
		<p class="normalText">
		After that, I was hooked and proceded to perform in the next few shows Debbie's Angels put together 
		including The Wizard of Oz as Aunt Em and Beauty and the Beast as Babette.  I even did an Onslow
		County Schools production of High School Musical as Random Nerd. During the DAP shows, I made friends
		with a few older kids and together we also did an adult (or mostly adult) production of Romeo and 
		Juliet in which I played Romeo's mother and the chick who gave him the poison to kill himself with 
		(respectivley; To be clear his mother did not give him the poison, that would be super fucked up and 
		not very motherly). It was even set in a dark carnival theme so I got to dress up as a gypsy.  But 
		that was when the story turned dark... Just kidding, it didn't, and this story isn't really even a 
		mystery, actually so I totally misled you but a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do to make people
		listen to (or in this case, read) her life story, especially one this boring.  The tale's not over 
		though so read on to hear about how I think I'm way smarter than I actually am.

		<br> <h1 class="otherHeader"> <br> <b> Once a Standardized Test Told me I was Smart and I've Been Annoying Ever Since </b> </h1>
		<p class="normalText"> 
		You got a glimpse of who I was as a 6th grader in the last section; A "chubby little girl who watches
		too much Glee and dresses like Ashley Tisdalecirca 2000," in the words of myself.  So how did I ever 
		get the confidence to rock that look?  Well, as the title suggests, once a standardized test told me I
		was smart and I've been annoying ever since.  Actually, it was more like a collection of pointless 
		tests with basically meaningless results that had no practical ramifications oncesoever for most people
		but, the point is, those meaningless results meant a lot to me.  Ever since kindergarden, I have been 
		told I was gifted.  I was always in the highest 'reading level' and in the group that got to leave the 
		class and work ahead of the others because we were just 'so much smarter', we were the royalty of the 
		academic pyramid so, naturally, it would be a sin to hold us down to the peasants' level of learning.  
		Now every kid wants to feel special but imagine every teacher actually telling you that from a young age,
		that you were destined for success.  You'd start believing it; Spoiler Alert: I did.  <br> </p>
		
		<p class="normalText"> <br> It got worse when I got into 3rd 
		grade and there were actual tests to tell you where you stood in comparison to the others. The EOGs or 
		End of Grade standardized tests were my proof that I was better than everyone else.  The other students 
		despised them for giving them a responsibility to study and the anxiety of a single test telling them 
		whether or not they should be alloowed to pass.  I, however, LOVED them. I didn't need to study, I never 
		even learned how and I was already told I was smart so I had no worry, only excitement.  When I got my 
		test results, they reaffirmed my suspicions that I was a Geniusâ„¢.  I scored higher than almost everyone 
		in the school and was immediatley thrown into the higher level classes  all the way through elementary 
		school.  In fact, I was the first student in the school to be certified as an AIG (Academically and 
		Intellectually Gifted) student which means, in fifth grade, I was taken out of class an hour and a half 
		a day to study one-on-one higher level material (Pre-algebra and Latin) with a new teacher.  When I got 
		to 6th grade, I was put in a class ahead of the others in which we learned our regular math and 
		Pre-Algebra.  Now, if you were paying attention, you'll remember that I already <em> learned </em> 
		Pre-algebra.  So now I'm in this class of smart kids and I already know the material so I'm seen as the 
		smartest of the already smart class.  Yes, my ego was affected accordingly.  But here comes the best part;
		I was asked to join a program called the Duke University TIP (Talent Identification Program).  That program
		involved taking the SATs in 7th grade. So when I scored well on that, I was ready to call up Steven 
		Hawkings and tell him I was definitley his daughter because there was no way my genius brain came from my 
		family, it just wasn't possible.  That's the end of this chapter but if you had fun reading about how my 
		self-esteem grew 18 sizes too big, you're gonna <em> LOVE </em> learning how it all toppled down and I 
		realized just how insignificant and average I am in the sequel.  Keep reading!

		<p class="normalText"> 
		If you were waiting to here how my self-esteem dropped like thee sickest of all beats, you'll have to wait
		a little longer because this is the story of how I became the almost decent makeup artist I am to this day.
		Remember when I said I did a production of Mulan?  Well, during that production we had a day when we all 
		got to take headshots.  If you don't know, headshots are basically pictures of your face and neck that you
		give to directors and casting agents so that they can judge you to see if they want you in their movie or 
		play or whatever.  You want to look your best for those so DAP had a proffessional make-up artist come in 
		and make us look presentable.  It was on that day that I fell in love with makeup.  Now, don't get me wrong,
		I was not an attractive girl so, even with the makeup, I didn't look great, but it was such a huge step up 
		from what I normally looked like, I swooned.  I swooned over the makeup God who made my face look decent, I
		swooned over the makeup she used to do it, and I swooned over the compliments I got from everyone once it 
		was on. From that day on I spent years doing shitty makeup through a trial and lots of error process to get
		to where I am now.  By the time I was doing Romeo and Juliet, I was good enough that they let me do my own 
		and even some of the other actors' makeup.  After succeeding there, I continued as a makeup artist at school
		where I charged people $5 to get their makeup done for the day and I did some of my friends' prom makeup. 
		Then, after seeing my makeup skills get better, DAP let me be a makeup intern for their next Jr. Broadway 
		show, Annie. I did the makeup for a bunch of kids and other teens for 5 shows.  Now I mostly do my own makeup
		for going out and such but hopefully, later this year, I will be doing their makeup again for Aladdin Jr..
